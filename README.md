# MeetingNotes

MeetingNotes is an example macOS and iOS app that illustrates using the Automerge-swift library to seamlessly merge document updates and synchronize updates between two running applications over the network.
The app is a multi-platform app, running on either iOS or macOS, and works on iOS v14 and higher, or macOS v11 and higher.

The Automerge-Swift library that powers this multi-platform SwiftUI app is open-source, available on Github at https://github.com/automerge/automerge-swift.
